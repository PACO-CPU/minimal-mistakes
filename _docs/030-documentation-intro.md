Our Documentation is split across three documents:

1. The [User Guide](/paco-cpu/docs/impl-doc.pdf#nameddest=sec:user-guide) gives
an introduction for new users and the beginners in using PACO.
2. The [Developer Guide](/paco-cpu/docs/impl-doc.pdf#nameddest=sec:developer-guide)
describes the implementation work done by the PACO team and indicates starting points for
further modification and contribution.
3. Working in conjunction with the Developer Guide, the [Design Document](/paco-cpu/docs/design-doc.pdf) elaborates on the
coarse-grained design of our modifications. 

For a complete and a thorough understanding of the PACO system, both the Developer Guide and Design Document are imperative.
