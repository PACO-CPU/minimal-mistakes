## Running the toolchain

To run an input C/C++ file you can use the run script (TODO: Do we have one? Where?). If you need for serveral reasons other compilation settings, you are free to edit the script or do the compilation step by step on your own. 
If you do not know how to annotate your code, please go to Tutorial -> Annotate Code. (TODO: link)

### Running the toolchain manualy

If you want to run the toolchain manualy, please look into the user guide. (TODO: link it)

### Sample applications

In the directory 

## Running a Program on the FPGA

### Prerequisites

To run a program the environment need to be installed, the CPU core has to be installed on the FPGA and you need a compiled program. 

### Load and run the program

You can load the program using this command:

```bash
$ riscv-uart-flash -i prog.elf -w
```

### Communicate with the program

You can communicate with the program by using uart commands in your program. For further detail, please look into the user guide. (TODO: link)
