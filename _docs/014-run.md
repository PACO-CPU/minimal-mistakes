That was easy wasn't it? Let us run an example application with the environment you have prepared so far. Well, I see that you are excited. Get on with it!

### Running the toolchain

There are several sample applications in the "rocket-soc/rocket_soc/lib/templates/" directory. 
#### explain how to run one of them. please dont forget to introduce the application in a sentence

You can use the sample applications to get familiar with the project. You could also use them as a template for your own code. 

#### Running a Program on the FPGA

If you have already build the hardware, then the sample application can be loaded and run in the FPGA.

#### Load and run the program

You can load the program using this command:

```bash
$ riscv-uart-flash -i prog.elf -w
```

#### what is the uart-flash? What are those arguments? Continue using the sample application as an example

#### Communicate with the program

You can communicate with the program by using uart commands in your program. For further detail, please look into the user guide. (TODO: link)
#### give an example. Then for further details look in to the document.

There is no guide for uninstallation. Sorry, you are stuck in the world of PACO forever! Now that you are anyways here to stay, learn to [create your own simple application](). Maybe you would be inspired to [contribute]() to PACO someday!
