# Getting started with PACO

~~Welcome on the webpage of the project PACO. PACO is an implementation of a CPU core which contains approximate computing units. In the current state, it consits two approximation units. The first is an approximate ALU which can add, substract and multiply approximately, the second one is lookup table, which selects a precomputed output for a specific function. 
The approximate ALU can be used to analyse approximation, the LUT also saves computation time up to be 3 times faster than a normal CPU would compute results. ~~

### introduction to the getting started section not of PACO.
The Getting Started guide helps you blah blah..
Now lets make sure you have all the required prerequisites.

## Prerequisite
PACO relies on [libuuid]() and [lua](), if they aren't already on your maschine, please install them. 
- libuuid is a *blah blah (oneline)* It is needed for Clang and LLVM. *which version is needed?*
- lua for the LUT Compiler....
- python is ... `python --version` checks the version running 

### explain what the prerequisites are, how to check if they are already installed 
### I think there are more prerequisites like Python and which version. please ask others

You also need some disc space free on your machine. ### Give a quantity or leave this sentence out

Now that you have all the prerequisites setup precisely [:wink], lets move on to [downloading]() PACO on your machine.

### Provide links wherever required
