## Download
Clone the entire project to your system. 

` $ git clone --recursive `

The `--recursive` flag saves you from cloning all subdirectories of the project manually. This instead, downloads the entire content to your main directory.

#### Be aware that entire project requires about 18GB of space on your system.
