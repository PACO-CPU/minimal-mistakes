## Download
To clone the entire project to your system:

` $ git clone https://github.com/PACO-CPU/paco-env.git --recursive `

The `--recursive` flag saves you from cloning all subdirectories of the project manually. This, instead, downloads the entire content to your main directory.

Or [download](https://github.com/PACO-CPU/paco-env.git)
