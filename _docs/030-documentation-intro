Our documentation is split across three documents:
The [User Guide]({{site.url}}/docs/impl-doc.pdf#nameddest=sec:user-guide) gives
an introduction for new users. The
The [Developer Guide]({{site.url}}/docs/impl-doc.pdf#nameddest=sec:developer-guide)
describes the implementation work done by us and indicates starting points for
further modification.
Working in conjunction with the Developer Guide, the
[Design Document]({{site.url}}/docs/design-doc.pdf) elaborates on the
coarse-grained design of our modifications. For a complete understanding of
the PACO system, both the Developer Guide and Design Document are required.
