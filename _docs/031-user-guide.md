The User Guide is the first part of the implementation document which serves
as a starting point for new users to understand the working environment of PACO.

### [Download the Implementation Document](/paco-cpu/docs/impl-doc.pdf)


Before any work can be done with the PACO system, the environment must be set
up. This is explained in the [step-by-step guide](/paco-cpu/docs/impl-doc.pdf#nameddest=sec:step-by-step-guide)
section of the User Guide. Following the step-by-step guide, the workflow of writing, testing and executing
applications to be approximated with PACO is elaborated in the section
[Run PACO Approximate Applications](/paco-cpu/docs/impl-doc.pdf#nameddest=sec:run-paco).
