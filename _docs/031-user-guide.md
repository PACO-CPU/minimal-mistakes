The User Guide is the first part of the
[implementation document]({{site.url}}/docs/impl-doc.pdf) which serves
as a starting point for new users in understanding the working environment of
PACO.
Before any work can be done with the PACO system, the environment must be set
up. This is explained in the
[step-by-step guide]({{site.url}}/docs/impl-doc.pdf#nameddest=sec:step-by-step-guide)
section of the User Guide.
Following the step-by-step guide, the workflow of writing, testing and executing
applications to be approximated with PACO is elaborated in section
[Run PACO Approximate Applications]({{site.url}}/docs/impl-doc.pdf#nameddest=sec:run-paco).
