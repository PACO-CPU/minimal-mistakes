### How does it work?
The Paderborn CPU Core for Approximate Computing (PACO) is a CPU that can compute inaccurately but faster & more energy-efficiently than a similar precisely-calculating CPU.

* How was it made faster / more energy-efficient? (Concepts)
* What technology is PACO based on? (Technology)
* How much speedup can I achieve? (Results)

### Origin
PACO has been created at the University of Paderborn, by a group of Master's students supervised by Prof. Christian Plessl and Dr. Paul Kaufmann. The code base is open source and builds on other open source projects.
