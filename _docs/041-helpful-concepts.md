### Similar projects
At the level of micro-architecture, different techniques of approximation were adopted to build approximate processors. @esmaeilzadeh2012architecture used two pipelines supplied with two different levels of voltage for precise and approximate processing. @venkataramani2013quality used precision scaling with error monitoring and compensation to facilitate quality programmable
 execution in a vector architecture. 

A quite different approach was used neural networks to build a co-processor. @esmaeilzadeh2012neural describes a program
 transformation that configures and trains a neural processing unit to mimic a region of imperative
 code.
