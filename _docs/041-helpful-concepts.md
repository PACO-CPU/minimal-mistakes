At the level of micro-architecture, different techniques of approximation were adopted to build approximate processors. [] used two pipelines supplied with two different levels of voltage for precise and approximate processing.  [] used precision scaling with error monitoring and compensation to facilitate quality programmable
 execution in a vector architecture. 

A quite different approach was used neural networks to build a co-processor.  [] describes a program
 transformation that configures and trains a neural processing unit to mimic a region of imperative
 code.
